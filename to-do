- newsletter archive to display top (4) content by issue date (meta) - x
- newsletter archive accordion display list name by issue date (meta) - x
- shortcode newsletter filtered by category

- auto add category as meta fields when added on news cpt category
-- this is base on ACF and its hard coded at the moment, dynamic is possible but well not rely on ACF
-- however i will check if theres a way in the ACF to auto add category added in CPT
-- changing names is not possible dynamically as it is hardcoded via ACF
-- displaying which category in the newsletter is hardcoded so featured first, standard 2nd and so on,
its possible but well code this, ill see if its possible with ACF

- migrate data from staging to production.
